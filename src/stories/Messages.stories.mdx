# Handling i18n

All of the 'date' features, themselves, are internationalized according the `locale` and `timezone` of your `defaultDate` prop. But, there are ARIA labels, attached to various buttons in the app, that are not internationalized. For this reason, we've provided facility for you to override these messages, using the `messages` prop. Here is a complete list of the current messages.

- dayButtonARIALabel: 'Sets date to ' (date automatically appended)
- previousButtonARIALabel: 'Show the previous month'
- nextButtonARIALabel: 'Show the next month'
- monthHeaderARIALabel: 'Change the year'
- yearHeaderARIALabel: 'Change the month'
- errors
  - minDate: 'You have tried to set a date before your minimum date',
  - maxDate: 'You have tried to set a date after you maximum date',
  - disabledDate: 'You have tried to set the date to a disabled date'

You override these messages using the `messages` prop:

```js
<DateSelector
  messages={{
    dayButtonARIALabel: `Устанавливает дату на `,
  }}
/>
```
