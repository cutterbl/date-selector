# DateSelector

You can expand the `code` of any section below for a simple usage example. It uses `useState` to track the value you select, and your `onChange` method to control the state. You're never resetting the value, until you actually select a 'date'. The `value` is a [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) `DateTime` object that you can then display or manipulate in anyway you like.

## Basic Control

Simplest utilization includes a `value` and an `onChange` prop. This example uses `useState` to track the `value` you select, and your `onChange` method to control the state. You're never resetting the `value`, until you actually select a 'date'. The `value` is a [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) `DateTime` object that you can then display or manipulate in anyway you like.

## defaultDate

By providing a `defaultDate`, not only can you start your calendar display on a specific date, but you can also use it to specify the locale and timezone being used. By doing so, all values pass to your `onChange` handler will also be in the same locale and timezone. For users of modern browsers, this means that the display is i18n by default.

```js
const defaultDate = DateTime.fromISO(new Date().toISOString(), {
  locale: 'fr',
  zone: 'Europe/Paris',
});
```

## isDateDisabled

You can provide a function to disable any date on the calendar the meet your criteria.

```js
isDateProvided = (date<DateTime>) => Boolean
```

<Canvas>
  <Story id="basics--is-date-disabled" />
</Canvas>

## minDate

You can provide a [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) DateTime object, defining the minimum selectable date. This means that dates on the calendar at or before that date will autmatically be disabled.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="basics--min-date" />
</Canvas>

## maxDate

You can provide a [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) DateTime object, defining the maximum selectable date. This means that dates on the calendar at or after that date will autmatically be disabled.

  <Story id="basics--max-date" />
