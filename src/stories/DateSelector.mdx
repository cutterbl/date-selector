# DateSelector

You can expand the `code` on the section below for a simple usage example. It uses `useState` to track the value you select, and your `onChange` method to control the state. You're never resetting the value, until you actually select a 'date'. The `value` is a [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) `DateTime` object that you can then display or manipulate in anyway you like.
