# DateSelector

The `DateSelector` is a simple control for picking a date from a small calendar control. This can be embedded in your page, placed in a modal or popper control, whatever you like.

## Installation

Simply install the package in your project:

```
npm i @cxing/date-selector
```

Then use it in your React template:

```
import DateSelector from '@cxing/date-selector';
```

All date values are expected to be [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) `DateTime` objects. Luxon is the modern replacement for [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/), developed by the same team.
