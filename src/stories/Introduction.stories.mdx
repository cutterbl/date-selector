# DateSelector

The `DateSelector` is a simple control for picking a date from a small calendar control. This can be embedded in your page, placed in a modal or popper control, whatever you like.

## Installation and Usage

Simply install the package in your project:

```
npm i @cxing/date-selector
```

Then use it in your React template:

```
import DateSelector from '@cxing/date-selector';
```

All date values are expected to be [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) `DateTime` objects. Luxon is the modern replacement for [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/), developed by the same team.

**NOTE:** `@cxing/date-selector` is an ES module, and has no UMD/CJS flavor. Bundlers like Webpack or Rollup will have no problem with it, but if you need it direct in the browser you'll need `<script type="module">`

## I18n, Timezones, and Browser Support

Because we're using [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/), under the hood, you get full i18n and timezone support when you use the `defaultDate` prop (unless, of course, you're using IE). Make sure to read the rest of the documentation, where we give an example of this.

[Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) is made for modern browsers. If you require support in [IE you'll need polyfills](https://moment.github.io/luxon/docs/manual/install.html#internet-explorer), and still won't get full i18n. Best bet? Don't support IE. Help inform the world of it's evil. Even [Microsoft is giving up on it](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-365-apps-say-farewell-to-internet-explorer-11-and/ba-p/1591666).

## TODO List

- [ ] Convert styling from SASS modules to [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)

## WATCH THIS SPACE!!!

I have a few other projects in the works that will utilize this component
