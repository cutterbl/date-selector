# Custom Component Overrides

There are a number of internal components that can be overridden

- LabelButton - The button in the middle of the header to move from one
  view to another
- PreviousButton - The button to move backwards in a view
- PreviousButton - The button to move forwards in a view
- DayButton - The button, in the 'day' view, to select a specific 'date'
  to set the `value`
- MonthButton - The button, in the 'month' view, to change the month
  displayed in the 'day' view
- YearButton - The button, in the 'year' view, to change the year
  displayed in the 'month' view

There's probably very little need for you to replace these buttons in
any way, but you can if you wish. These components will receive the
props they need to do the necessary logic within the component.

Replacing the components is easy, by using the `components` prop. You can replace one, several, or all of them at once. First, write your component

```js
export const MyCustomLabelButton = (props) => <someelement {...props} />;
```

Then you include it in your props.

```js
<DateSelector
  components={{
    labelButton: MyCustomLabelButton,
  }}
/>
```

The props passed down include things like ARIA labels, `onClick` handlers and the like. My suggestion is that you grab the actual component from [source code](https://github.com/cutterbl/date-selector) to use as a template.
